   Is given bread and milk for tea.
   He says his father killed a bear.
   He says his mother cuts his hair.
   He wears goloshes when it's wet.
   I've heard his people call him “Pet”!
   He has no proper sense of shame;
   He told the chaps his Christian name.
   He cannot wicket-keep at all,
   He's frightened of a cricket ball.
   He reads indoors for hours and hours.
   He knows the names of beastly flowers.
   He says his French just like Mossoo—
   A beastly stuck-up thing to do—
   He won't keep <em>cave</em>, shirks his turn
   And says he came to school to learn!
   He won't play football, says it hurts;
   He wouldn't fight with Paley Terts;
   He couldn't whistle if he tried,
   And when we laughed at him he cried!
   Now Wigsby Minor says that Parr
   Is only like all new boys are.
   I know when <em>I</em> first came to school
   I wasn't such a jolly fool!
