  With all his heart and soul,
And if he had a wish on earth
  It was to keep it whole.
One day—my friends, prepare your minds;
  I'm coming to the worst—
Quite suddenly a screw went mad,
  And then the boiler burst!
With gloomy face he picked it up
  And took it to his Mother,
Though even he could not suppose
  That she could make another;
For those who perished on the line
  He did not seem to care,
His engine being more to him
  Than all the people</blockquote></div> </div>
