The fact is I am growing very fond of her. The more I observe her the more I love her. And I notice all sorts of things about her that I like.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">For instance, she was quite oddly anxious to make other people happy. And she could keep a secret, a tolerably rare accomplishment. Also she had the power of silent sympathy. That sounds rather dull, I know, but it's not so dull as it sounds. It just means that a person is able to know that you are unhappy, and to love you</p></div> </div>
