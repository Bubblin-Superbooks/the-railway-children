Phyllis enjoyed herself thoroughly. She had never been a real heroine before, and the feeling was delicious. Peter's ears got very red. Yet he, too, enjoyed himself. Only Bobbie wished they all wouldn't. She wanted to get away.</p><p>“You'll hear from the Company about this, I expect,” said the Station Master.</p><p>Bobbie wished she might never hear of it again. She pulled at Peter's jacket.</p><p>“Oh, come away, come away! I want to go home,” she said.</p><p>So they went. And as they went Station Master and Porter and guards and driver and fireman and passengers sent up a cheer.</p></div> </div>
