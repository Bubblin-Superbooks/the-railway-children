He seemed a most charming and sensible man, interested in railways, and rabbits, and really important things.</p><p>When he had seen Mother, he said it was influenza.</p><p>“Now, Lady Grave-airs,” he said in the hall to Bobbie, “I suppose you'll want to be head-nurse.”</p><p>“Of course,” said she.</p><p>“Well, then, I'll send down some medicine. Keep up a good fire. Have some strong beef tea made ready to give her as soon as the fever goes down. She can have grapes now, and beef essence—and soda-water and milk, and you'd better get in a bottle of brandy. The best brandy. Cheap brandy is worse than poison.”</p></div> </div>
