The song the others were singing now went like this:—</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Our darling Roberta,
   No sorrow shall hurt her
   If we can prevent it
      Her whole life long.
   Her birthday's our fete day,
   We'll make it our great day,
   And give her our presents
      And sing her our song.
   May pleasures attend her
   And may the Fates send her
   The happiest journey
      Along her life's way.
   With skies bright above her
   And dear ones to love her!
   Dear Bob!  Many happy
      Returns of the day!
When they had finished singing they cried, “Three cheers for our Bobbie!” and gave them very loudly. Bobbie felt exactly as though she were going to cry—you know that odd feeling in the bridge of your nose and the pricking in your eyelids? But before she had time to begin they were all kissing and hugging her.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
