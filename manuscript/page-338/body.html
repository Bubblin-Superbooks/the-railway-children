And he stopped within a yard of what they had come into the tunnel to look for. Phyllis saw a gleam of red, and shut her eyes tight. There, by the curved, pebbly down line, was the red-jerseyed hound. His back was against the wall, his arms hung limply by his sides, and his eyes were shut.</p><p>“Was the red, blood? Is he all killed?” asked Phyllis, screwing her eyelids more tightly together.</p><p>“Killed? Nonsense!” said Peter. “There's nothing red about him except his jersey. He's only fainted.
