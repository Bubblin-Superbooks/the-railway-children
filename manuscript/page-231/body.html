<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">man, giving Peter's ear a twist—not a hard one—but still a twist.</p><p>Peter could not say that it was. Bobbie and Phyllis had been holding on to the railings above and skipping with anxiety. Now suddenly Bobbie slipped through the railings and rushed down the bank towards Peter, so impetuously that Phyllis, following more temperately, felt certain that her sister's descent would end in the waters of the canal. And so it would have done if the Bargee hadn't let go of Peter's ear—and caught her in his jerseyed arm.</p><p>“Who are you a-shoving of?” he said, setting her on her feet.</p><p>“Oh,” said Bobbie, breathless, “I'm not shoving anybody. At least, not on purpose. Please don't be cross with Peter. Of course, if it's your canal, we're sorry and we won't any more. But we didn't know it was yours.”</p><p>“Go along with you,” said the Bargee.</p></div> </div>
