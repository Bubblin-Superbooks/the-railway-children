All I ask is that if Mother asks where I am, you won't blab.”</p><p>“We haven't got anything TO blab,” said Bobbie, indignantly.</p><p>“Oh, yes, you have!” said Peter, dropping horse-beans through his fingers. “I've trusted you to the death. You know I'm going to do a lone adventure—and some people might think it wrong—I don't.
