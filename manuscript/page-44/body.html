It was very securely nailed down.</p><p>“Where's the hammer?” asked Peter.</p><p>“That's just it,” said Mother. “I'm afraid it's inside the box. But there's a coal-shovel—and there's the kitchen poker.”</p><p>And with these she tried to get the case open.</p><p>“Let me do it,” said Peter, thinking he could do it better himself. Everyone thinks this when he sees another person stirring a fire, or opening a box, or untying a knot in a bit of string.</p><p>“You'll hurt your hands, Mammy,” said Roberta; “let me.”</p><p>“I wish Father was here,” said Phyllis; “he'd get it open in two shakes. What are you kicking me for, Bobbie?”</p><p>“I wasn't,” said Roberta.</p></div> </div>
