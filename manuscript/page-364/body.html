We found a hound in a red jersey in the tunnel, and he's broken his leg and they're bringing him home.”</p><p>“They ought to take him to the vet,” said Mother, with a worried frown; “I really CAN'T have a lame dog here.”</p><p>“He's not a dog, really—he's a boy,” said Bobbie, between laughing and choking.</p><p>“Then he ought to be taken home to his mother.”</p><p>“His mother's dead,” said Bobbie, “and his father's in Northumberland.
